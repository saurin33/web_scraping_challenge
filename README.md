# Web Scraping

In this assignment, I used BeautifulSoup to scrape data from several websites containing Mars news. Different types of data included were images of Mars, tweets about the current Mars weather, a table of Mars facts, and headlines with the latest Mars news. After scraping the data, I stored the data in MongoDB and then loaded it into an HTML file using a Flask/Jinja template that interfaces with Python. Finally, I formatted the HTML using Bootstrap and configured the app such that clicking a button on the webpage would re-scrape and load the data.
